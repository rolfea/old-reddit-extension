# Old Reddit

## What is this?

I prefer the UI from the old Reddit. I grew tired one day of manually adding `old` to my URLs, so I made this little plugin to do it for me.

## Try It Out

Clone the repo and then navigate to chrome://extensions/ and turn "Developer Mode" on.

Click "Load Unpacked" and select the directory of the cloned project.

Now navigate to [any Reddit page](reddit.com/r/AITAH) and watch the magic happen.
